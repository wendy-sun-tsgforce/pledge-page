## Quick start

1.  Download the project's zip.
2.  Make sure you have node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/>) installed.
3.  Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located.
4.  You will find all the branding colors inside `src/assets/scss/paper-kit/_variables.scss`. You can change them with a `HEX` value or with other predefined variables.
5.  Change REACT_APP_API_URL in `.env` file to the location of the back-end server.
6.  Run in terminal `npm start`. Also make sure the back-end server is running too.
7.  If you want to deploy this to a server, run `npm run-script build`. This will compile code into minified JavaScript that can be deployed anywhere.

### Bootstrap 4 support

Paper Kit React is built on top of Bootstrap 4 using React and Reactstrap, so it fully supports them. Most of the elements from the framework are re-designed to resemble sheets of paper and color pastels. If the are elements that we have not touched, they will gracefully fall back to the Bootstrap 4 default.
